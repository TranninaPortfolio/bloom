		<h1>Bloom</h1>
		<img src="extra1.jpg" align="left">I like this layout ('cause I like the wallpaper it was based off of . . .). In fact, I like it so much, I was truely tempted to use it for my <i>main layout</i>. Yes. A dinky little thing like this for my main layout. Just shows how much I like it, huh? =) But back to that first side comment bubble...A tables layout based off of a wallpaper?? Amazing. It's actually not a pop-up..! I've made a break through. Anyways...You could use this layout for pretty much anything. Good for a blog, since the content is pretty much all the space here (though it's not very big, as you can see), or for a fansite (what for, I don't know), or collective, whatever. Heck, if you were really organized about it, it could even be a graphics site (sub menus on other pages, small preview clips, etc.). See? I could have managed using this...If I had cut back on some graphics, too...And yes, there is only one extra for this one. Sorry~
